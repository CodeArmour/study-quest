    question: "Explain the difference between call stack and task queue in JavaScript event loop.",
    answer:
      "The call stack is a data structure that records where in the program we are. When we call a function, it's added to the stack. When we return from a function, it's removed from the stack. The task queue (or callback queue) is a list of functions ready to be processed. When the call stack is empty, a function is taken from the task queue and pushed onto the call stack. This is part of the event loop mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations despite being single-threaded.",

    question: "What is the time complexity of quicksort in best, average, and worst cases?",
    answer:
      "Best case: O(n log n) - This occurs when the pivot chosen divides the array into roughly equal halves each time.\nAverage case: O(n log n) - On average, quicksort performs well with random data.\nWorst case: O(nÂ²) - This happens when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element, such as in an already sorted array if always choosing the first or last element as pivot.",

    question: "Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript.",
    answer:
      "A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. A closure allows a function to access variables from an outer function even after the outer function has finished execution. This is possible because the inner function maintains a reference to the outer function's scope chain.",

    question: "What is the difference between 'let', 'const', and 'var' in JavaScript?",
    answer:

Can be updated but not redeclared within its scope. Not hoisted to the top of its scope.\n\nconst: Block-scoped variable declaration. Cannot be updated or redeclared. Must be initialized at declaration. For objects and arrays, the properties/elements can still be modified.",
